MUMBAI: Yes Bank has reported a net profit of Rs 151 crore for the quarter ended December 2020 as compared to a loss of Rs 18,560 crore in the corresponding quarter of previous year. Sequentially, the profits were marginally higher than the Rs 129 crore reported in the preceding quarter ended September 2020. The bankâs board, which met to approve the results, also cleared a proposal to raise up to Rs 10,000 crore through issue of shares. The bank will now seek shareholdersâ approval for fund-raising. In its results, the bank said that forensic audits for remaining accounts in respect of which the bank had received a whistleblower complaint in 2018 are in the process.
