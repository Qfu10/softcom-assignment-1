Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani doubled down on his promise to offer 5G services on his wireless network as early as this year, as his conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd. reported a record profit aided by its consumer businesses. The groupâs wireless operator, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. -- Indiaâs largest -- has started advance tests to prepare the fifth-generation, high-speed network, it said in a statement Friday. But the tycoonâs plans hinge on the availability of spectrum as the Indian government still hasnât auctioned the required airwaves. The Mumbai-based group, whose businesses span oil refining and petrochemicals to retail and telecommunications, said itâs testing the transmission speeds using locally-developed equipment. Reliance Jio, with almost 411 million users, reported a 15.5% jump in profit for the three months through December from the preceding quarter, while earnings margins before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization touched 47%. Net income at the group rose 13% from a year earlier, beating analyst estimates. The latest quarterly results bolster Ambaniâs ambitions to transform Reliance from an energy giant into a technology titan -- a pivot that has received $27 billion from global investors including Facebook Inc. and Google. Ambani, Asiaâs second-richest man, promised last month that Jio will be the first to roll out 5G in India in the second half of this year. Heâs looking to lure nearly 300 million users still on the older 2G technology offered by Jioâs rivals. Affordable, Available âJio will continue to accelerate the roll out of its digital platforms and indigenously developed next generation 5G stack and make it affordable and available everywhere,â Ambani, Relianceâs chairman, said in the statement. âJio is determined to make India 2G-mukt,â or 2G-free, he said. The 63-year-old tycoonâs 5G plans, however, are contingent on the Indian governmentâs auction of airwaves specifically allotted for these services. No date has been announced for this spectrum auction. Jio, backed by its cash-rich and net-debt-free parent, is in the pole position to offer 5G services, whenever government rules allow, at possibly dirt-cheap prices, in what may be an encore of its debut strategy. Reliance Jio disrupted Indiaâs telecom market in 2016 when it entered with free calls and super cheap data, forcing rivals to merge, quit or go bankrupt. Paying OffAmbaniâs bet on consumer services -- telecom and retail -- seems to be paying off despite the pandemic, helping the conglomerate offset a slump in its crude oil refining business Key highlights of Reliance Industriesâ quarterly earnings: Net income beat estimates to rise 13% y-o-y to 131.01 billion rupees ($1.8 billion)  Consolidated revenue fell 21% to 1.24 trillion rupees  Total costs dropped 22% to 1.13 trillion rupees  Jioâs 3Q profit at 34.9 billion rupees  Jioâs average revenue per user rose to 151 rupees  Total debt, as of Dec. 31, stood at 2.57 trillion rupees
