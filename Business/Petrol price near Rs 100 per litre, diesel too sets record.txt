NEW DELHI: Petrol price reached Rs 2.50 short of a hundred at Ganganagar in Rajasthan, crossed the Rs 92 per litre-mark in Mumbai and made a new record at Rs 85.5 in Delhi â considered the benchmark market â after retailers raised prices on Friday after a two-day lull. Diesel, too, made new records in Mumbai and Delhi at Rs 82.4 and Rs 75.6, respectively, as the staggered impact of rising crude was passed on to consumers and amplified by high central and state taxes. Even as the clamour for a tax cut grew louder to mitigate the impact of relentless rise in pump prices, the government shifted the blame on Opec, the grouping of oil-exporting countries accounting for about 40% of global production and 60% of traded supplies.
