PUNE: Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on Friday that the two Covid-19 vaccines given approval for restricted use would not be available in the open market till the countryâs apex drug regulator, Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), approved the data sought from their manufacturers. âAs of now, no time frame can be set for the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in the open market. The governmentâs focus now is only on covering the priority population in the next seven-eight months,â Bhushan told TOI. He added that no market authorisation has been given to any of the emergency-approved vaccines currently in use in India and abroad. âThe market authorisation comes after the stipulated follow-up on all the trial phases,â he said. Market authorisation is a pre-requisite to sell vaccines in the open market.
