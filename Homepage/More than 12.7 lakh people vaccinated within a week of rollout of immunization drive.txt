NEW DELHI: The total number of beneficiaries vaccinated exceeded 12.7 lakh within a week of the rollout of the massive immunization drive against Covid-19 on January 16. The government has stepped up efforts to tackle vaccine hesitancy and tried to instill confidence about safety and efficacy of the jabs. Over 2.28 lakh beneficiaries received the jab on Friday â which was the seventh day since the launch of the drive. Officials said launch of the awareness drive and enhancements on the Co-WIN platform to allow addition of new beneficiaries who were not scheduled for a session also helped improve the numbers. The government is expecting the drive to further pick up pace over next week with the expansion of the awareness campaign and minor glitches in CO-WIN also resolved completely. The government may also sign up celebrities to drive home the message of vaccine safety. A total of 6,230 sessions were held on Friday for the pan-India vaccination drive. So far 24,397 sessions have been conducted for the drive. "The cumulative number of healthcare workers vaccinated against Covid-19 has surpassed 12.7 lakh (12,72,097) (till 6 pm on Thursday) through 24,397 sessions, as per the provisional report," the ministry said in a release. "Total 2,28,563 beneficiaries were vaccinated till 6pm today through 6,230 sessions, the seventh day of nationwide Covid-19 vaccination. Final reports would be completed for the day by late tonight," it added. On Friday, 267 cases of adverse event after immunisation (AEFI) were reported till 6pm. The government plans to inoculate three crore health and frontline workers by March end. In the second round of the vaccination drive, 27 crore âpriorityâ population including people over 50 years of age and those below 50 but with severe comorbidities will be covered. Going forward, people will also have a choice to book appointments for getting vaccinated at a place and time of their choice.
