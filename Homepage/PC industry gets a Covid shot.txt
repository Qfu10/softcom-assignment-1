The pandemic has boosted the PC industry as hundreds of millions of people work, teach and study from home. This has led the industry to have its best year since 2015, according to research firm Gartner. It estimates that global PC shipments grew 10.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020, providing a strong finish to an already good year. Total shipments were about 275 million.
