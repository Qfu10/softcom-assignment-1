Apple is gearing up to launch a new MacBook Air model later this year or early 2022 as per a report by Bloomberg. The upcoming MacBook Air will reportedly be âthinner and lighterâ despite maintaining the same 13-inch display. The next MacBook Air will be powered by Apple's own M series chip and could run the M1 chipset. The current MacBook Air weighs 1.2 kgs and is little more than half an inch thick. It would be interesting to see how Apple manages to shrink weight further. Apple had plans to launch a 15-inch MacBook Air version but it is not happening anytime soon. The upcoming MacBook Air will host four USB Type-C ports along with a mini-LED display. âIt will include Apple's MagSafe charging technology and a next-generation version of the company's in-house Mac processors,â the report by Bloomberg said. Thereâs very little information about how the MagSafe charging will be integrated into the MacBook Air. If you are planning to buy a new MacBook Pro then you have two options-- 13-inch Macbook Pro with Appleâs own M1 chip or the 16-inch model with Intel Core i9 processor. The same M1 chip also powers the new MacBook Air. Now, it is quite natural to assume that the Intel Core i9-powered MacBook Pro will offer more firepower than the M1 chip. But you may be wrong to look down upon the new M1 chip just because the same chip also powers the MacBook Air. As per a listing by Geekbench, the MacBook Air with M1 chip backed by 8GB RAM and macOS 11.0.1 operating system outperformed the Intel Core i9-9880H processor which powers the 16-inch MacBook Pro. Talking about clock speed, the M1 chip has a base frequency of 3.2GHz compared to the 2.3GHz of the Intel Core i9 version.
