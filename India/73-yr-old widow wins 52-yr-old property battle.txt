AHMEDABAD: Fifty-two years of struggle later, a 73-year-old widow from Nadiad in Kheda district finally inherited her husbandâs land. It took her five decades to gather evidence against her brother-in-law who had grabbed 43 bighas of land that should have rightfully gone to her after her husbandâs death. She provided proof of the forgery to authorities, following which police booked the accused. Leela married Sampatsinh Mahida, a resident of Nadiadâs Arera village, in 1967. A year later, he died and she returned to her parentsâ house to live out her remaining days as widow remarriage was prohibited in her community. While staying there, she learnt in 1968 that her husband had ancestral land in Arera which she could inherit as he had passed away. When she asked her brother-in-law Mahipatsinh about it, he didnât give her a straight answer. Leela then began inquiring about the plotâs location and size, besides getting details of government offices from where she could obtain information about the property. Meanwhile, several of Mahipatsinhâs joint family died without leaving heirs. About four decades later, Leela finally managed to get a document from a Mamlatdar office stating that Mahipatsinh was the sole owner of the property. On probing further, she learnt that he had produced a forged succession certificate of their family, which neither mentioned her or her late husbandâs name. She produced these documents before a special investigation team of Kheda collectorate which started investigating the matter, and on December 18, 2020, concluded that Mahipatsinh had committed forgery. Following this, rural police booked Mahipatsinh and helped Leela take possession of the property.
