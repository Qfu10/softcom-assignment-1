RAJKOT: Gir Somnath district officials on Saturday confirmed the regionâs first case of bird flu in poultry birds. Around 220 poultry birds were culled in one day while restriction orders were issued in the entire district regarding consumption and sale of eggs and chicken. More than a dozen poultry birds were found dead in Dolasa village of Kodinar taluka a few days ago. The carcasses were sent for forensic testing and the report on Friday night confirmed avian influenza. A team from the animal husbandry department surveyed the area and culling orders were given to four poultry farms within 1km radius from the affected farm. The district administration said that the entire area has been disinfected and a 10km radius area has been declared as surveillance zone for the next 60 days.
