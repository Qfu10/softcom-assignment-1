KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday cried âhumiliationâ as chants of âJai Shri Ramâ by a section of the crowd rent the air in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi just when she got up to speak at the official event commemorating Netaji Subhas Chandra Boseâs 125th birth anniversary in Kolkata. Mamata, who had been invited to address the gathering before the PM, termed the sloganeering âpoliticisation of a dignified eventâ before returning to her seat. Modi made no reference to the row in a speech laced with Bengali sentences. Mamata hadnât even started speaking when she was greeted with the âJai Shri Ramâ chant from the crowd seated on Victoria Memorialâs eastern lawn. Security and protocol officials said the first five rows were reserved for VIP guests, but the rest of the crowd â numbering around 5,000 â comprised âmostly BJP supportersâ. A visibly angry Mamata immediately protested against the alleged heckling. âThis is not a political event. I am grateful to the PM for organising this in Kolkata. But it does not suit you to invite someone and then insult that person. I refuse to speak as a mark of protest. Jai Hind! Jai Bangla!â Mamata said. #WATCH | I think Govt's program should have dignity. This is not a political program....It doesn't suit you to insuâ¦ https://t.co/o7X5HPNDEZ— ANI (@ANI) 1611402420000The turn of events cast a shadow on the celebrations and sparked a bitter political row on the birth anniversary of one of Indiaâs most-revered freedom fighters. Trinamool Congress condemned the sloganeering at a solemn ceremony. âIt was pre-planned. No word is enough to condemn the indiscipline and lack of decency while remembering Netaji,â Trinamool MP Saugata Roy said. BJP found itself divided on the issue, with some calling it unfortunate and some others questioning the CMâs response. âShe felt insulted when some people welcomed her with âJai Shri Ramâ slogans. What kind of politics is this?â BJP Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya said. Senior BJP functionary Shamik Bhattacharya, however, differed. âThe slogans at the programme were undesirable and unfortunate,â he said. PM Modiâs speech in Hindi was peppered with Netaji quotes in Bengali. âI bow before the sacred land of Bengal that brought up little Subhas and taught him to grow through sacrifice. Netajiâs sacrifice and perseverance are todayâs youthâs source of energy. We want generations to remember him. His birthday will be celebrated as Parakram Diwas (day of valour),â he said. Wondering how Netaji would have felt had he seen the new India taking shape today, Modi remarked: âFrom LAC to LoC, the world is witnessing a powerful avatar of India once envisioned by Netaji. India today is giving a befitting reply wherever attempts are made to challenge its sovereignty.â The PM pointed out that Netaji used to treat poverty, illiteracy, disease and lack of scientific innovation in the country as its primary problems. âToday, our nation is striving to make women and farmers self-reliant and strengthening education infrastructure. We are introducing a new national education policy,â he said. Modi said Netaji would have been proud to see India help other nations with Covid-19 vaccines. âNetaji once asked people not to lose hope of a free India. Similarly, no one can stop India from being self-reliant,â the PM said, adding that India would continue to walk the path shown by Netaji to create âSonar Banglaâ.
