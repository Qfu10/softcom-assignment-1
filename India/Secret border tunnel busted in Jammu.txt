JAMMU: Less than a fortnight after a cross-border tunnel used by terrorist infiltrators was unearthed in the Hiranagar sector of the LoC in Jammu, the BSF on Saturday detected another such underground passage around 150 metres long and 3 feet deep. The secret underground route is the fourth one to be detected in the last six months along the Samba, Hiranagar and Kathua axis of the international border. "Acting on specific intelligence inputs, the BSF found another tunnel in the Pansar area of Kathua district early Saturday. The tunnel is located between border outposts 14 and 15," a BSF spokesperson said. On January 13, a 150-metre-long tunnel had been unearthed at Bobiyaan village of the same sector. The BSF had shot down a Pakistani hexacopter carrying weapons and ammunition in the same area last June. The other two tunnels discovered in J&K last year are in Samba district. The first passage was found on August 28 and the other one on November 22. "In Jammu, 10 underground terrorist routes connecting either side of the border have been dug out over the past decade," the BSF spokesperson said. Meanwhile, a joint team of the BSF, the Army and police busted a terrorist hideout and seized a cache of arms and ammunition in the Hari Buddha area of Poonch district. The haul includes an AK-47 rifle, three AK-47 magazines, three Chinese pistols, five pistol magazines, four hand grenades, a UBGL grenade, 82 rounds of AK-47 ammunition, 33 rounds of pistol bullets and a radio set.
