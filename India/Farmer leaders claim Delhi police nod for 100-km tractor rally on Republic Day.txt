NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police on Saturday gave its nod to protesting farmers to hold 100-km tractor parade on Republic Day in the national capital, farmer leaders claimed. The tractor parades will start from the Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri border points of Delhi, but details will be finalised tonight, farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar said after attending a meeting between the unions and the police. Thousands of farmers will participate in the parade, there will be no single route, farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni said. Meanwhile, Delhi police has said that the protesting farmers have not given them anything in writing regarding the route of proposed tractor rally. "When the protesting farmers would give us in writing about the route of the proposed tractor rally on January 26, we will analyse it and take a decision," Delhi police said. Farmer Unions also claimed that the Delhi police will remove the barricades set up at border points on January 26 and the farmers will return to border points after the tractor rally. "The rally will be completely peaceful. There wonât be any disruption to any official function on that day," farmer leaders said. The government's negotiations with representatives of thousands of protesting farmers hit a roadblock after the farmer unions rejected the Centre's proposal to put three farm laws on hold. Farmer leaders have said that they would settle for nothing less than a complete repeal of the laws, enacted in September last year, which they find pro-corporate, and a legal guarantee for the procurement of crops at government-fixed MSP (minimum support price).
