RANCHI: Incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad was shifted to AIIMS in New Delhi in an air ambulance on Saturday evening on the recommendation of doctors at Ranchi's Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, where he was undergoing treatment while serving prison terms in several fodder scam cases. Accompanied by daughter Misha Bharti, Lalu was wheeled out of RIMS at about 5.15pm and taken to the airport. Laluâs wife, former Bihar CM Rabri Devi, and younger son and the leader of the opposition in the Bihar assembly, Tejashwi Yadav, were also on the air ambulance. Inspector general (prisons) Birendra Bhushan said he granted permission to shift Lalu on the basis of the RIMS medical boardâs recommendation. "The permission is valid for a month and can be extended on the recommendation of the doctors at AIIMS, where he will be treated under police protection," he said. Dr Umesh Prasad, who was part of the RIMS medical board constituted for the RJD leader, said, "We referred Lalu Prasad to AIIMS for better treatment. His lung infection is a new problem, but he is stable. We have requested that due to his acute heart problem, Lalu should be first admitted in the cardiac department while other departments may also be involved. The final decision in this regard would be taken by the AIIMS management." According to a medical bulletin released by RIMS on Saturday, Laluâs test reports were normal except for the blood parameters, which showed some infection.
