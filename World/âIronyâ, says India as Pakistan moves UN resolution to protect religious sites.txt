NEW DELHI: In another India-Pakistan face-off at the UN, after Pakistan co-sponsored a resolution promoting a culture of peace, India described as a matter of great irony that a country where a Hindu temple was recently demolished, and where minority rights are being emasculated, was introducing such a resolution. The UN General Assembly on Thursday adopted the resolution, promoting a culture of peace and tolerance to safeguard religious sites, that condemned all acts or threats of violence, destruction, damage or endangerment, directed against religious sites as such, that continue to occur in the world, and denounced any moves to obliterate or forcibly convert any religious sites. The resolution was co-sponsored by Pakistan along with 21 other nations. India, in the explanation of position on the resolution, cited attacks on the Hindu temple in the Pakistani town of Karak, against a Sikh gurdwara as well as destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas in Afghanistan, and said in the world of growing terrorism, violent extremism, radicalisation and intolerance, religious sites and cultural heritage sites remain vulnerable to terrorist acts, violence and destruction. âThe resolution cannot be a smokescreen for countries like Pakistan to hide behind,â said India, reiterating its call for application of principles of objectivity, non-selectivity and impartiality to form the basis of discussions at the UN.
